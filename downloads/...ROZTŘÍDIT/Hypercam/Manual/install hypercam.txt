    How to guide: Installing Hypercam (mipsel) on the Dreambox DM800/DM8000 & DM500.



    Short how to guide on how to install Hypercam on the Dreambox DM800, DM500, Dm8000 and compatible clones.


    Installing Hypercam (mipsel) on the

    Dreambox DM800/DM8000 & DM500




    Hypercam version to run on your DM800 and Mipsel DM8K, ??here’s what to do:



        Create a folder hypercam at the root of the DM, telnet to the root, do: 



    cd / mkdir hypercam


        Take a bit hypercam.mipsel.xxxx (xxxx = full / tiny / lite), put it in the directory /hypercam previously created
        Transfer the file hypercam.cfg also present in the archive in the /hypercam
        Rename hypercam.mipsel.xxxx in hypercam.mipsel in telnet in the /hypercam : 



    mv hypercam.mipsel.xxxx hypercam.mipsel

    - Put the rights to hypercam.mipsel 755, telnet, always in the /hypercam :

    chmod 755 hypercam.mipsel

    - Put the file in the directory hypercam.cfg

    /hypercam

    -Then you need to tell where the hypercam.mipsel hypercam.cfg file to function. To do this, you type in telnet :

    /hypercam/hypercam.mipsel -c /hypercam/hypercam.cfg

    Finally, for hypercam that starts automatically at each reboot of the demo, you must do so (AHF Thanks for the tip) :

    Edit the :

    /etc /init.d/bootup

    You’ll find this :


    echo 22 > /proc/progress
    /usr/bin/dccamd

    Change the second line like this :

    echo 22 > /proc/progress
    /hypercam/hypercam.mipsel -c /hypercam/hypercam.cfg
