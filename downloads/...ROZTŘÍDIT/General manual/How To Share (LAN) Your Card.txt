-Blue Panel/Addons/Download & Install/Cam-config/"Newcamd Config v6.0x Betad"
-Blue Panel/Right-Left Buttons/Selection of the "Newcamd-Cardserver 6.10b"
Emu/Green Button (Stop/start Cam) to activate the selected Emu

** ATTENTION 1 :
When you download the "Newcamd v6.10b-Complete" Emu , 4 components are installed into your system :
- Newcamd 6.10b complete
- Newcamd 6.10b betad
- Newcamd 6.10b cardserver
- Newcamd 6.10b spider
YOU MUST KEEP IN YOUR SYSTEM THE "Newcamd 6.10b complete" and the "Newcamd 6.10b cardserver" emus and ACTIVATE (via the Blue Panel)
the last one ("Newcamd 6.10b cardserver").
YOU DON'T NEED IN YOUR SYSTEM THE other 2 emus (Newcamd 6.10b betad and Newcamd 6.10b spider) , so you can erase them :
GO TO BLUE PANEL/ADDONS/DELETE and erase the 2 emus , TO FREE SOME SPACE IN THE MEMORY FLASH OF YOUR SYSTEM.

** ATTENTION 2 :
When you download the "Newcamd config 6.0x betad" , 3 config files (components) are installed in your system (var/tuxbox/config/newcamd/):

- "betad.cfg"
- "cardserv.cfg"
- "newcamd.conf"

You need the "cardserv.cfg" & "newcamd.conf" files.

-Run the Filezilla 2.2.32 FTP Client on your PC and press "Quickconnect"
(http://sourceforge.net/project/showf...group_id=21558)

Address : DMBox's IP = 192.168.1.3 (Menu/Setup/System/Network/IP Address)
User : root
Password : dreambox
Port : 21

Go to "var/tuxbox/config/newcamd/" and download to your PC the 2 config files :

i> the "cardserv.cfg" file &
ii> the "newcamd.conf" file.

Open them with Wordpad/Notepad and add the necessary parameters , as shown :

i> This is how the "Cardserv.cfg" file must look like :

- local : the cardserver's pwd (LAN connection)
- lan : the type of connection
- localhost : the cardserver's local (LAN) IP address = 192.168.1.3 You could also attribute to the cardserver the following (by default) internal IP
address : "127.0.0.1" (known as "localhost")
- au : auto-update

**USER (Client/DM7025)
- ClientUsername : the client's loginID (exactly the same with the Client's Username appearing in the DM's 7025 "newcamd.conf" file)
- ClientPwd : the Client's password , exactly the same with the Pwd appearing in the DM's 7025 "newcamd.conf" file)
- lan : the type of connection between the 2 DMBoxes
-LocalClientIP : the Client's (DM 7025) LAN IP Address = 192.168.1.4
- au : auto-update

ii> The "newcamd.conf" file is used IN ORDER TO ALLOW TO THE CARDSERVER <DM 500> TO CONNECT TO ITSELF VIA THE <ONE & ONLY> SERIAL PORT (=1) <the cardreader slot authorised in the "cardserv.cfg" file> AND ITS ASSOCIATED TCP PORT 10001 (the SHARING PORT)

** THE OTHER DMBoxes (7000/7020/7025) HAVE 2 CARD SLOTS
<SERIAL PORT=0 (Upper slot)/SERIAL PORT=1 (lower slot)-the ASSOCIATED TCP Ports are 10000 & 10001>.

(double click or drag & drop) the "mg cfg" file. Open it with WordPad.
Check the LINES G (network mode) and P (network shares priority).
Make shure that the settings are :

* G: { 01 } <newcamd netclient> &

Close the session and upload from the PC straight to the DM 7025 (usr/keys) the "mg cfg" file.

ii> Go to etc/tuxbox/config/ and , via FTP , download to your PC (folder of your choice) the "newcamd.conf" file. Open it with WordPad (or Notepad) and add the
following LINE :

CWS = ServerIP ServerPort ClientUsername ClientPwd DESKEY lan servername au

Control Word Server ("CWS") :
*"ServerIP" : The Cardserver's (DM 500) <LAN> IP Address = 192.168.1.3
*"ServerPort" = 10001 {The Administrator <who shares the original subscription> defines the Cardsharing Port Number (TCP Port) and informs the Client about it}
* "ClientUsername" : The Administrator defines a " Client Login ID" and informs the Client about it <the "loginID" is CASE SENSITIVE>
*"ClientPwd" : The Administrator defines a "Login password" and informs the Client about it <the "login password" is CASE SENSITIVE">
*DESKEY : 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 (this is used for coding packets while sharing)
*"lan" (OPTIONAL for 1 subscription/1 card slot) : to caracterise the nature of the connection between the 2 DMBoxes
*"servername" (OPTIONAL for 1 shared subscription/1 card slot) : the Administrator defines it and informs the client about it
*"au" : autoupdate

This is how the "newcamd.conf" file must look like :
Quote:
"newcamd.conf - Wordpad"

SHOW_ALL_CA_SYSTEMS = no
OSD = none
CA_INFO_FILE = /tmp/cainfo.txt
CWS = LocalServerIP ServerPort ClientUsername ClienPwd DESKEY lan servername au {ACCORDING TO THE EXAMPLE GIVEN , the CWS Line is :
CWS = 192.168.1.3 10001 ClientUsername ClientPwd 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 lan servername au}
Close the session and upload <overwrite> the modified "newcamd.conf" file straight to the appropriate directory of the DM 7025 (etc/tuxbox/config/"newcamd.conf").

ATTENTION 1 :
If you were using the emulators ("newcamd 6.10b cardserver" & "mgcamd 1.22-complete") BEFORE the modifications made to the associated config files , you must restart the emus (Blue Panel-Green button: start/restart cam) , in order to apply the changes.

ATTENTION 2 :
Right after the activation or reactivation of the emus , the "cardsharing process" begins. If something went wrong and you didn't succeed , GO TO
BLUE PANEL-ADDONS-DELETE and erase the config files associated to the used Camd Emulator (STEP BY STEP : FIRST THE "CLIENT CONFIG" FILES ,THEN THE "CARDSERVER CONFIG" FILES). DOWNLOAD & REINSTALL THE SAME CONFIG FILES , REFRESH THE VIEW OF FILEZILLA FTP (to get the right information) AND RECONFIGURE AS ALREADY DESCRIBED.

**ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION (3+1)**

YOU COULD ALSO USE THE COMBINATION OF "MGcamd 1.22/NewCS 1.20" EMU , WITH EXACTLY THE SAME CONFIGURATIONS (NOTHING ELSE TO ADD OR REMOVE) AND THE SAME RESULTS (A LITTLE BIT SLOWER IN THE RECOGNITION PROCESS OF ****** 2 , BUT FULLY FUNCTIONAL).
AFTER HAVING ACTIVATED THE ABOVE CONFIGURATIONS , JUST GO TO BLUE PANEL AND SELECT THE "MGcamd 1.22/NewCS 1.20" Emu instead of the "MGcamd 1.22" emu. PRESS THE GREEN BUTTON TO ACTIVATE THE SELECTED EMU.
{The "MGcamd 1.22/NewCS 1.20" emu is installed in your system (DM 7025) , SINCE YOU DOWNLOAD THE "MGcamd 1.22-complete" emu file :

a> CONFIGURATION OPTION 1 {1 Config File : the "CCcam cfg"}

Go to /etc/ and download from the DM 7025 straight to your PC (double click or drag & drop) the "CCcam cfg" file. Open it with WordPad.
YOU MUST DEFINE "CCcam" Emu as a "NEWCAMD NETCLIENT" , in order to make it COMPATIBLE with the cardserver emulator used
("Newcamd cardserver 6.10b") by the Administrator.

Just add the following N ("Newcamd") Line :

N: ServerIP ServerPort ClientUsername ClientPwd DESKEY lan servername au

ServerIP : the Server's LAN IP ADDRESS = 192.168.1.3
ServerPort : the Cardsharing Port Number <TCP PORT = 10001>

1> The "mg cfg" file (usr/keys/). You don't need it. Go to Blue Panel/Addons/Delete and erase it from the list.
2> The "Newcamd.conf" file (etc/tuxbox/config/). YOU DEFINITELY NEED IT , IN ORDER TO MAKE "CCcam 1.7.1" Emu FULLY COMPATIBLE with the "Newcamd protocol" used by the Administrator.
Run Fillezilla FTP Client on your PC and modify the "Newcamd.conf" file , by adding the CWS Line (follow the instructions prementioned in the 2nd WAY of Cardsharing process configurations).
