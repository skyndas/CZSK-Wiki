Mgcamd binaries based on the last public version 1.35a patched by D2MAC.

1.38 -	Added STN support (Macedonian channels with CaID 0x0616 on 16E)
	SH4 binary needs replace.list - see the attached example key files
	Fixed Nagra2 Kabel Deutschland decoding - there must be "X: { 18 01 }" in your priority.list to let mgcamd
	select the correct ECM pid value corresponding to nagra2 ECM stream. If you still have problems with crashes
	on KD channels (especially new E2 images), use previous version of libcrypto.so library in /usr/lib/.

1.37 -	Removed this very annoying log message: "[mgcam] read error error 145: Connection timed out"
	Added Zee TV support
	Small fixes in the ppc binary
	Added ppc_old and SH4 binaries
	The SH4 binary is based on the version 1.35 and has its own replace.list !!!
	See the attached replace.list and example SoftCam.Key files for Zee TV and C+NL (SH4)
		
1.36 -	Added support for ICE EMM stream with both headers (8X 40 and 8X 70)
